Chatbot for a NGO using Machine Learning Models

	The steps involved in the project are:

1. Exploring the dataset also visualizing as well as cleaning the data set .

2. Data preprocessing

3. Building a prediction model for the dataset

4. Evaluating the models

5. Applying Naive Bayes

6. Applying Random Forest

7. Final model creation and analysis outcome.

	Final result of analysis:

The accuracy obtained is 90 (Random Forest algorithm) and 70 (Naive Bayes Algorithm).
